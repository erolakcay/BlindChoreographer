Julia code for simulations from The blind choreographer: evolution of social norms and correlated equilibria.
Authors: Bryce Morsky and Erol Akcay

The code runs simulations for the Nash Bargaining Game on a given graph with varying number of vertices and alpha (division of the dollar).

complete -> code for the complete graph
ringK1 -> code for the ring graph with K=1
ringK2 -> code for the ring graph with K=2
WSK1 -> code for the Watts-Strogatz model with initial conditions of a ring graph with K=1
WSK2 -> code for the Watts-Strogatz model with initial conditions of a ring graph with K=2
